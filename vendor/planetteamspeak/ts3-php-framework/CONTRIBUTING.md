# How to contribute

We are open to contributions from everyone! 3rd-party support goes a long way
towards maintaining and improving the framework. Nothing is too small, from pull
requests to reporting bugs, everything helps!

## Ways to contribute

* Having trouble or find a bug? [Open an
issue!](https://github.com/planetteamspeak/ts3phpframework/issues/new)
* Add a feature or fix a bug:
  * Check for existing issue or create a new one.
  * Fork the repo, make your changes.
  * Create a pull request, and reference the issue.
* Add examples, tests, or improve documentation.

## Test

When committing code, please make sure to test before creating a pull request.

We use PHPUnit for testing, feel free to add new tests. This is not a
requirement, but helps us maintain code coverage.

@ToDo: Add sections: test environment setup, running tests, examples
